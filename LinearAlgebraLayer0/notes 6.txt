-"output earlyOutReady; reg earlyOutReady = 0; (causes problem if is in a branch of generate block, else no problem)"
	problem in simulation
		check _Use_Registered_earlyOutReady_If_Available from DotProduct_SoE_V4_5-Copy1, e.g. DotProduct_9_S1E_HRx9_C1_A0
		any other occurences?
		better to change also for when not in a generate block branch
	simulate error:
	ERROR:HDLCompiler:482 - "DotProduct_9_S1E_HRx9_C1_A0.v" Line 98: Illegal duplicate name created during elaboration, multiple declarations created for 'earlyOutReady'
	synthesize warning: Redeclaration of ansi port ... is not allowed

- functions: has testbench or not? if yes, generate or not?

- simulation return value:
	return code must be 0 (means simulated, not Succeeded or Failed)
	open output file and copy result from it.

- random verilog parameters? (possibly more than 1 combination for each project)

- flush report file after each project

* add other needed info to project report file

add 2 mode traverse for (original) parameters (start_end, directly_listed)

*Simulate subprocess call:
	why fuse needs shell=True (using both multiple args or single string)? may lead to lock or not?
